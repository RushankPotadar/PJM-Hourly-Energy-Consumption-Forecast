# ⚡ PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Forecast

This project aims to forecast hourly energy consumption for PJM Interconnection LLC using machine learning and time series modeling techniques. PJM is a regional transmission organization in the U.S. serving various states and the District of Columbia.

## 📈 Project Objective

The goal is to:
- Analyze hourly energy consumption trends across seasons, hours of the day, weekends, and holidays.
- Build predictive models to forecast demand for the next 30 days.
- Deploy a web app to interactively view and download forecasts.




## 📂 Project Structure

PJMW\_MW\_Hourly/

* PJMW\_MW\_Hourly.xlsx            -   # Historical hourly power consumption data (in MW)
* PJMW\_MW\_Hourly - 7.ipynb       -   # Main notebook for EDA, preprocessing, modeling
* deployment\_final.ipynb          -   # Notebook for deployment using Streamlit
* random\_forest\_model.pkl        -   # Trained Random Forest model for forecasting
* app.py                           -   # Final Streamlit app script
* Requirement\_document.docx       -   # Business and technical requirement overview



## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Time-series decomposition and visualization
- Analysis of seasonal trends and autocorrelation
- Holiday and weekend consumption comparisons
- Preprocessing including datetime formatting and sorting

## 🔧 Model Development

- **Random Forest**: Used for the final deployment model
  - Features: hour, day, month, year, weekday, season, weekend/holiday flags
  - Evaluation on train-test split (last 1 year as test set)
- Other models experimented: Linear Regression, XGBoost (if applicable)

## 🚀 Web Application (Streamlit)

The app provides:
- Forecast for up to 30 future days
- Interactive plots using `matplotlib`
- Downloadable forecast as CSV
- Suggestions for improvements

### To run locally:


pip install streamlit pandas joblib matplotlib openpyxl
streamlit run app.py


## 📊 Sample Forecast

The model uses engineered time-based features to produce short-term energy demand forecasts, useful for planning and operational efficiency.

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Incorporate weather data for improved accuracy
* Holiday auto-detection using external APIs
* Hour-level forecasting granularity
* Add confidence intervals around predictions

## 📝 Authors & Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of a data science internship. The dataset was obtained from PJM's public records. Special thanks to mentors for guidance on modeling and deployment strategies.

### 📌 How to Use

* Clone this repository to your local system.
* Open and run **`PJMW_MW_Hourly - 7.ipynb`** to explore the data, train the model, and generate the `random_forest_model.pkl` file.
* Run **`app.py`** to launch the Streamlit web app.
* Use the generated **`random_forest_model.pkl`** to make predictions on new data via the app.
